    "# Couch-Potato Movie Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "# Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team is building a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset (100,000 user ratings) to provide personalized movie suggestions. The primary goal is to recommend the top 5 movies a user is most likely to enjoy based on their historical rating patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Users often struggle to discover movies that match their preferences when faced with large movie catalogs. Without personalized recommendations, users may:\n",
    "- Spend excessive time browsing without finding suitable content\n",
    "- Miss movies they would enjoy\n",
    "- Experience decision fatigue leading to reduced engagement\n",
    "\n",
    "Our recommendation system addresses this by analyzing user rating patterns to surface movies that align with their tastes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Technical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement **Collaborative Filtering (CF)** as our core recommendation methodology. Collaborative filtering works by identifying users with similar movie preferences and recommending movies that similar users have enjoyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- When a user rates movies, the system finds other users with similar rating patterns\n",
    "- The system identifies movies that similar users rated highly but our target user hasn't seen\n",
    "- These movies become our recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**: User's existing movie ratings  \n",
    "**Output**: Top 5 personalized movie recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Key Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sparse Data**: Most users rate only a small fraction of available movies, making it harder to find similar users and identify patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cold Start Problem**: Users with few ratings are particularly challenging for collaborative filtering, which relies on having enough rating history to find meaningful similarities with other users. We need to ensure our system can provide reasonable recommendations even for users with limited rating history.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Success Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "We will evaluate our recommendation system using multiple metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Measures how accurately we can predict what rating a user would give to recommended movies\n",
    "  - *Target*: RMSE < 1.0 (within 1 star of actual rating)\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Precision@5**: What proportion of our top 5 recommendations are actually good matches that users would rate highly\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Coverage**: Percentage of users for whom we can generate meaningful recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Segment Performance**: Evaluate how well the system performs for users with different amounts of rating history (e.g., 5 ratings vs 50+ ratings)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Expected Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing collaborative filtering, we aim to deliver a recommendation system that helps users discover movies they'll enjoy, reducing search time and improving their overall experience with the movie catalog."
